# What is this for?

This folder should be used to store data used/generated by kedro pipelines. All data here should be made accessible to kedro via an appropriate entry in catalog.yml. The folder is split into 5 "environments" and each of these into 8 folders following the [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention). We reccomend tracking at minimum the raw data and resulting models with dvc, backed by an external data store (see the project README for details on setting up an AWS s3 bucket remote).

## Base data

The `base` folder is for data shared by all environments, for example a raw dataset.

## Local data

The `local` folder is for data used/generated by local pipeline runs.

> *Note:* This should not be DVC tracked. Deployable models should be trained via CI/CD to ensure reproducibility.

## Test data

The `test` folder is for data used/generated by test pipeline runs either locally or during CI.

## CI data

The `ci` folder is for data used/generated by pipeline runs during CI/CD.

## Prod data

The `prod` folder is for artifacts to be used in a production environment, e.g. trained models which have been accepted for production use.
